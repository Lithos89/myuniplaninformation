      <h2>Survey</h2>
      <p>We the creators of My Uni Plan are developing this product in the class of ENTI 317 (Entrepreneurship and Innovation 317). Our primary reason for releasing our prototype is for beta-user testing with Haskayne School of Business students (such as yourself) to gain data for our project presentation. After you have tried out My Uni Plan, please consider filling out this <a>survey</a> as it can really make a difference if you want to see this service integrated into the University of Calgary!</p>

      <h2>How To Use</h2>
      <p>
        The basic feature of My Uni Plan is to deconstruct complicated degree structures like the Bachelor of Commerce into a simple and elegant diagram. By hovering over courses (clicking not yet added), you can see every course required to take a certain course. At the moment, only singular required courses are properly higlighted. Choice requirements as indicated by the dashed purple line indicate that you have a choice as to which prerequisite requirement to fill. The red solid line indicates neseccary prerequisites and when highlighted is represented in blue.
      </p>
      <p>
        Courses are highlighted as well as their prerequisite courses when you hover over a course box. These course boxes are movable so you can orient the diagram in any way you like!
